It covers all the activities that are related to examination management, right from receiving enrollment and examination forms, to the processing of exams, printing, distribution, and statistical reports.

## OBJECTIVE 

This project explains about examination management system which includes the below features
- Add/Delete the Details of the Students
- Check Eligible Students for Exams
- monitoring attendence for the students
- Printing the records of the students
- Set/Edit Eligibility criteria for exams

## SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY :

## TIME COMPLEXITY :

O(1) time complexity that requires O(n) space complexity. it is simpler to write, and debug and more importantly, there are no loops!

## SPACE COMPLEXITY :

O(n) in space complexity.

## SYSTEM DESIGN

## Best Methods To Be Followed

* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Used structures and arrays to accept the inputs from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of Employee management system.
* Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
* Unit testing is done to avoid any computational errors.
